Change Color Condition: Change colors of turtles whose who value is between 1-25, 26-50, 51-75, and 76-100 to colors red, green, blue, and yellow respectively
Turtles Move Condition: All turtles turn to the specified direction and moves forward 1 step for every tick [red -> NE, green -> SE, blue -> NE, yellow -> SE]
Kill Condition: Blues and Yellows are a team, so is Reds and Greens. When within radius 1, they kill the opposite team but only when the other turtles X-coordinate is low
Kill Probability Condition: Assume that the probability that was set using the slider is ‘P’, then the kill probability should be P / x, where ‘x’ is the x-coordinate of the turtle.[Only when the switch is on]
