Change Color Condition: Change colors of turtles whose who value is between 1-25, 26-50, 51-75, and 76-100 to colors red, green, blue, and yellow respectively
Turtles Move Condition: All turtles turn to the specified direction and moves forward 1 step for every tick [red -> N, green -> N, blue -> S, yellow -> S]
Kill Condition: Blues and Yellows are a team, so is Reds and Greens. When within radius 1, they kill the opposite team but only when the other turtles X-coordinate is low
Kill Probability Condition: Assume that the probability that was set using the slider ‘P’, then the kill probability should be P / y, where ‘y’ is the y-coordinate of the turtle.[Only when the switch is on]
