Change Color Condition: Change colors of turtles whose heading is between 0-90, 91-180, 181-270, and 271-359 to colors red, green, blue, and yellow respectively
Turtles Move Condition: All turtles turn to the specified direction and moves forward 1 step for every tick [red -> NE, green -> SE, blue -> NE, yellow -> SE]
Kill Condition: Blues and Yellows are a team, so is Reds and Greens. When within radius 1, they kill the opposite team but only when the other turtles X-coordinate is low
Kill Probability Condition: Assume that the probability that was set using the slider ‘P’, then the kill probability should be P / y, where ‘y’ is the y-coordinate of the turtle.[Only when the switch is on]
