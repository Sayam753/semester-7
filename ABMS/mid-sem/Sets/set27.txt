Change Color Condition: Change colors of turtles whose heading is between 0-90, 91-180, 181-270, and 271-359 to colors red, green, blue, and yellow respectively
Turtles Move Condition: All turtles turn to the specified direction and moves forward 1 step for every tick [red -> N, green -> S, blue -> W, yellow -> E]
Kill Condition: Blues and Greens are a team, so is Reds and Yellows. When within radius 1, they kill the opposite team but only when the other turtles Y-coordinate is low
Kill Probability Condition: Assume that the probability that was set using the slider is ‘P’, then the kill probability should be P / x, where ‘x’ is the x-coordinate of the turtle.[Only when the switch is on]
